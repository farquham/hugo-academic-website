A stock 3d printer from a kit was heavily modified to improve reliability and quality of prints.

By reinforcing sections suffering from intense vibrations and securing the printer to a table using 3d printed brackets, the quality of prints was improved, and reliability of first layer adhesion became signficantly better.

In addition to the improvements aimed at vibration reduction, an auto-bed leveling sensor was installed along with an improved z-axis mechanism. These changes improved first layer adhesion further and also improved the quality of taller prints due to reduced vibrations caused by the original z-axis mechanism.

Finally octoprint was installed and connected to the system, allowing constant print monitoring and remote control of the system.
